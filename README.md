# Here are my notes about Command Line!

Cat - looks into a file

ls - lists what’s there in whatever you ask for
cd - actually CHANGES where we are

pwd - shows where we are

clear - cleans it up

tab - completes what I’m typing

mv - move … 

the “*” at the beginning or end of a thing takes everything with a prefix or suffix (like *.doc or Screen Shot*)

rm - removes 

so “rm *.docx” would remove all the docs?

mkdir - makes a new place
 so “mkdir “Word Docs”” makes a new folder called Word Docs

mv “Things to Move” “Where to move them” (order)
mv can also rename everything

git - used to trigger the git language
git init - starting (starts an empty git repository)

git status - shows what's happening 
git add - stages whatever you add
git commit - adds the thing that was on the stage to the timeline (place of existence)
git log - shows me the literal log of what happened 

1. create a thing (no "git" really needed) 2. add the thing ("git add") 3. Commit the thing into the river ("git commit")

git remote add origin "a link" - from my computer, I'm adding a location (another server) where code lives (github link)

After I remote I can PUSH

"git push origin master" - pushing to a place called origin on a branch called master! 

git pull - would grab the changes on the server not on my machine yet, and show them to me (if someone else did them)
