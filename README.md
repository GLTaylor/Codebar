# Here are my notes about Command Line!

Cat - looks into a file

ls - lists what’s there in whatever you ask for
cd - actually CHANGES where we are

pwd - shows where we are

clear - cleans it up

tab - completes what I’m typing

mv - move … 

the “*” at the beginning or end of a thing takes everything with a prefix or suffix (like *.doc or Screen Shot*)

rm - removes 

so “rm *.docx” would remove all the docs?

mkdir - makes a new place
 so “mkdir “Word Docs”” makes a new folder called Word Docs

mv “Things to Move” “Where to move them” (order)
mv can also rename everything
